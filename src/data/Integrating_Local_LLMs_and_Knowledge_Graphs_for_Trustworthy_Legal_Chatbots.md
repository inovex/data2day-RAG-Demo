# Integrating Local LLMs and Knowledge Graphs for Trustworthy Legal Chatbots
A specialised question-answering bot must prioritise robustness,
trustworthiness and proper sourcing. While Large Language Models (LLMs) hold
promise for improving chatbots, issues such as hallucinations and monolingual
limitations pose challenges. In addition, concerns about data security hinder
the adoption of hosted LLMs such as OpenAI in many organisations.  
  
Our German Law-bot addresses these challenges by integrating a local LLM with
a knowledge graph (KG). We're evaluating several small local LLMs, building
workflows incorporating KG retrieval, and refining models to ensure accurate
and reliable legal answers. Our focus is on refining answers based on expert
feedback.
## Vorkenntnisse
Basic knowledge of or interest in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Knowledge
Graph (KG).
## Lernziele
  * Create workflows that merge KG retrieval to improve QA bot capabilities.  
  * Understand the performance of local LLMs in German contexts.  
  * Implement expert feedback for iterative improvements.  
  * Gain insight into AI-driven QA system development through interdisciplinary collaboration.  
  * Learn evaluation methods for assessing QA bot performance.
