# Size recommender: a data-driven approach to fashion sizing
Online shopping has transformed fashion retail, offering convenience but
posing challenges. At the forefront of it is the persistent problem of size
returns, stemming from the limitations of online shopping where customers are
unable to try before they buy.  
  
We would like to introduce a data-driven size recommender to address this
dilemma and enhance not only the cost efficiency but also customer
satisfaction. By leveraging historical return data, we analyzed and labeled
articles, discerning size patterns, and then employed machine learning to
predict size labels. The performance was validated through rigorous A/B
testing, and it showed remarkable success by a promising reduction in returns.
## Vorkenntnisse
A general understanding of data science, machine learning, and data-driven
solutions in the context of retail would enable attendees to fully comprehend
the content.
## Lernziele
In this presentation, we delve into the journey of developing and implementing
our data-driven size recommender. From the initial data analysis and labeling
to the application of machine learning techniques for prediction, we outline a
comprehensive process to improve the online shopping experience.
