# Strategic Data Methods: A Safari Tour for Data People
As data science and engineering work matures and evolves, our efforts become
even more relevant to product-facing applications. Data scientists and
engineers begin to work in a more cross-disciplinary environment. To
facilitate this transition, we need non-technical tools in our toolkit.
Fortunately, we can borrow more than enough from other fields.  
  
In this talk, I’ll cover the most tried and tested strategic data methods.
They include Design Thinking, Domain-Driven Design, Value Stream Mapping, and
others. For each technique, I’ll describe the motivations behind its origin,
and how it has been applied through the years in different contexts. We’ll
then dive deeper into practical examples from a data context. Finally, I’ll
provide a template you can reuse and adjust for your situation.  
  
To get the most out of this talk, you should be a data scientist, analyst, or
engineer who works at least semi-regularly with other teams, such as marketing
or product.
## Vorkenntnisse
Attendees should have several years of experience in a product organization.
Individual contributors will benefit from this talk, but ideally, they have
experienced regular interactions with non-data team members (from other tech
teams, product, marketing, etc.).
## Lernziele
By getting exposure to diverse methods, attendees can conduct first sessions
in their organizations. They will be able to customize the methods to the
needs of their particular case. Finally, they will also be able to work more
productively with members of adjacent teams, helping deliver better data-
powered products for their organizations.
