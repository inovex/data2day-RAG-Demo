# The Power of Knowledge Graphs and AI: A New Era for Developers and Data
Scientists
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are data structures that can capture complex
relationships between concepts in a very flexible way. They excel at
harmonizing huge amounts of heterogeneous data, and we can train AI models to
generate embeddings of its nodes and vertices. These embeddings can be used to
infer knowledge from the graph, such as when Facebook suggests friends you may
know.  
  
Ready to dive into the world of AI and Knowledge Graphs? We'll learn the
technical side of these algorithms, their real-world applications, and how to
overcome their limitations. We'll also explore current lines of research to
combine them with LLMs. Join us to learn about the future of AI and how you
can use it!
## Vorkenntnisse
It's better if you have been working with ETL pipelines / data lakes / big
data in general so that you're familiar with the challenges usually faced.
It's also better if you have a high-level knowledge of what's going on in AI,
and even better if you've already used embeddings.  
  
However, if that's not you, it's alright! We'll explain everything :)
## Lernziele
My session will provide a comprehensive understanding of KGs and their
applications in AI. It will also introduce the audience to the concept of
hybridizing KGs with LLMs, which is a cutting-edge area of research in AI.
This knowledge will help data practitioners understand the future of this area
of AI and how they can leverage it in their work. Moreover, KGs are a NoSQL
area novel to many people, being a solid tool to dealing with big data.
