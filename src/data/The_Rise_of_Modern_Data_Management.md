# The Rise of Modern Data Management
In this session, Chad Sanderson, CEO of Gable.ai and author of the upcoming
O'Reilly book "Data Contracts," tackles the necessity of modern data
management in an age of hyper iteration, experimentation, and AI. He will
explore why traditional data management practices fail and how the cloud has
fundamentally changed data development.  
  
The talk will cover a modern application of data management best practices,
including data change detection, data contracts, observability, and CI/CD
tests, and outline the roles of data producers and consumers.  
  
Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of modern data management's
components and how to leverage them for better data handling and decision-
making.
